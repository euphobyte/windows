### SSH into a Linux server

From the windows command line execute the ssh command followed by the userid that wants to login followed by the name or IP address of the server.  The two should be seperated by the '@' symbol. This is an example of such a session:

```
D:\Users\userA>ssh user@10.10.10.1
user@10.10.10.1's password:

Last login: Mon Mar 16 13:00:21 2020 from 10.10.10.2
user@server:~ $
```
